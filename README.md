# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
* I am using OpenCV to capture images and the Haar cascade Algorithms to detect a face/s in the images.
* The detected facial emotion will be classified in the captured picture with the help of a NN model 
* This model was trained with over 20k images and it has a successful classification accuracy of over 80%.


A little background
* The Haar cascade algorithms were initially presented in a research paper by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001. The paper titled "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" introduced these algorithms.
